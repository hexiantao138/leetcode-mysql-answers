* I collect some sql exercises in leetcode and upload it with my own answers to github.
* As a data analyst or data scientist, it's very important to get familiar with database codeing techniques.
* I practice that everyday in leetcode and I will continuously update this project in github.
* I hope this kind of exercise can help me to get a data analyst/data scientist job.
